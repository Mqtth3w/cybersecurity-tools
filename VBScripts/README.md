# VBScripts

Check this four minutes [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QI-WrzOna3o) to learn why a VBScript is interesting and how to automatically run a script through a USB pen once inserted on a Windows machine like a rubber duck.

## My scripts
- [copyBrowserProfiles.vbs](./copyBrowserProfiles.vbs) Copy the Firefox and Chrome browsers profiles to the USB pen. It takes around thirty seconds (depends on the number of profiles)
- [copyMainFolders.vbs](./copyMainFolders.vbs) Copy the Desktop, Documents and Images folders to the USB pen. May take a while

### Joke script tricks
- [msgboxInf.vbs](./msgboxInf.vbs) Open a message box impossible to close
- [script.vbs](./script.vbs) Open the notepad to type a message
- [shutdown.bat](./shutdown.bat) Shutdown the machine
- [voice.vbs](./voice.vbs) Start an infinite voice loop
